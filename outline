In this repository, there are model1 and model2 folders.
By model1 we refer to the model where node embeddings are given directly as hidden state inputs to the decoder
By model2 we refer to the model where hiddenstate values are calculated from node embeddings
and these values are given to the decoder.

As the embeddings file for model2 and model file(.h5file) of model1 were large, they has been uploaded in drive and the link was shared via email.

Outline of model1:
embedding dimension: 100
walklength and num walks = 20 and 10
#epochs trained: 50
optimizer:adadelta
batch size:64

Outline of model2:
embedding dimension: 200
walklength and num walks = 20 and 10
#epochs trained: 50
optimizer:adadelta
batch size:64
