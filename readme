This repository contains file related to the thesis work - generating textual node description from network information.

There are two models in this work, their files have been uploaded in their respective folders.

model1:

33.csv is the dataset used to generate node embeddings
33_absdataset is the file containing writer names and one line abstracts.
33_100d_online.emb is the node embeddings file

mynodeembeddings.py - to generate embeddings
retry_online.py - to adjust tab between the text and embedding values for further processing. 
n2s_noclac.py - actual implementation of the model1.
bleuscore_1.py - to calculate bleu scores.

accuracy, loss graphs file can be found in the outputfiles folder
model.h5 file has been uploaded in drive and the link has been shared.
result file on which bleuscores were calculated can be found in results folder.


model2:
33.csv is the dataset used to generate node embeddings
